### Prefab

This Prop places a Prefab in a suitable spot. This Prop uses a Directionality asset, a Pattern and a Scanner to locate a suitable spot relative to its provided position. A BlockMask asset can also be used to specify which Materials the Prefab cannot replace in the world, which Materials the Prefab cannot place, and even which world Materials cannot be replaced by specific Prefab Materials. See the BlockMask documentation.

Prefab Prop also support Molding to the terrain. To enable Molding you must specify a MoldingDirection of DOWN or UP, and provide a MoldingScanner and MoldingPattern. If you want your Prefab’s children to also mold, you need to set the MoldingChildren to true. I recommend you use a LinearScanner with the Local parameter set to true for the MoldingScanner, and limit the ResultCap to 1. In a typical ruin Prefab, the MoldingScanner and MoldingPattern can be used to find the floor or ceiling to mold the ruin to.

#### Parameters:

### Column

Generates a prop that is completely contained within a column.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "ColumnBlocks",
      description:
        "list of BlockTypes and Y coordinates. The Y coordinates are relative to the Prop's origin (anchor block). Contains BlockType (string BlockType) and Y (the Y integer coordinate relative to the Prop's origin).",

    },
    {
      name: "BlockMask",
      description: "BlockMask asset slot. Optional.",
    },
  ]}
/>

---

### Cluster

Places a cluster of Column type Props relative to its origin. The DistanceCurve determines the density depending on the distance from the Cluster’s origin. The Column Props are picked from a weighted list.

The Column Prop assets provided to this Cluster Prop must use Scanner and Pattern assets that only read within the origin column because that is the only space the Cluster Prop will provide to them. If the Column Prop provided reaches outside its column, the Prop will not be used by the Cluster Prop. This is to maintain consistent Context-Dependency.

Below is a diagram showing how the density varies in function of the distance, and how the DistanceCurve affects it.

![Example of Cluster Prop distance curve](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/props/cluster-distance-curve.png)

The Pattern and Scanner asset slots are optional. By default, the Cluster Prop will use the Position it is assigned to. If a Pattern and Scanner are provided, it will use those to position the Cluster’s origin.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Range",
      description:
        "integer. Determines the distance in blocks from the origin of the cluster to its limit. A good starting range is 10.",
    },
    {
      name: "DistanceCurve",
      description:
        "a curve that determines the chance a block will have a Column Prop based on its distance from the Cluster’s origin.",
    },
    {
      name: "Seed",
      description:
        "string. Used during density and Prop picking from the weighted list.",
    },
    {
      name: "Pattern",
      description:
        "optional Pattern asset slot, used to position the Cluster’s origin.",
    },
    {
      name: "Scanner",
      description:
        "optional Scanner asset slot, used to position the Cluster’s origin.",
    },
    {
      name: "WeightedProps",
      description:
        "list of weighted Column Props. Each element in the list contains:",
    },
    {
      name: "Weight",
      description: "floating point value above 0.0.",
    },
    {
      name: "ColumnProp",
      description:
        "slot for a Column Prop asset (only Column Prop assets can be used here). This Prop will only have access to a column to both scan and place. This means that you need to ensure your Scanner and Pattern assets operate within that column. If this is violated the Prop might fail to place to keep Context Dependency consistency.",
    },
  ]}

### Union

This Prop type places all the props in the provided list at the same position one after the other.;

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Props",
      description: "list of props to place together.",
    },
  ]}
/>

---

### Offset

Offsets the position of the child Prop.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Offset",
      description:
        "3D integer vector. The direction in which to offset the child Prop's position.",
    },
    {
      name: "Prop",
      description: "Prop slot.",
    },
  ]}
/>

---

### Weighted

Picks which Prop to place based on a seed and weights.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Entries",
      description:
        "Entry containing: Weight (greater than 0.0) and Prop (Prop slot).",
    },
    {
      name: "Seed",
      description:
        "string. The seed determining which Prop is picked. This seed also mutates the seed passed to the children.",
    },
  ]}
/>

---

### Queue

It places the first Prop in the queue that can be placed. Whether a Prop in the queue can be placed depends on that Prop’s type and configuration. A Box Prop, for example, can only be placed if its Scanner and Pattern configuration finds a valid position.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Queue",
      description:
        "ordered list of Prop asset slots. First entry is the highest priority.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### PondFiller

It fills up depressions in the terrain with the provided MaterialProvider.

The screenshots below show a few examples of ponds generated with this Prop.\

![Example of PondFiller Prop1](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/props/pondfiller-example-1.png)

![Example of PondFiller Prop2](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/props/pondfiller-example-2.png)

You can configure the bounding box inside which it will identify and fill-in existing terrain depressions. The bounding box’s size and shape determines how large the resulting ponds can be.

The diagram below shows how the bounding box defines the outcome.

![Example of PondFiller bounding box](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/props/pondfiller-bounding-box.png)

The Pattern and Scanner can be used to position the origin of the Filler Prop like any other Prop. The origin anchors the bounding box at runtime. The ponds that fit inside that bounding box are filled with the MaterialProvider.

The BarrierBlockSet defines what the walls of the depressions are made of.

Important: The performance impact of this Prop can be relatively high depending on the size of its bounding box. Because of that, I recommend optimizing the size of its bounding box for each use-case.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "BoundingMin",
      description:
        "3D point. Defines the lowest corner of the bounding box relative to the anchor point. Contains X, Y, Z (floating point numbers).",
