### Origin

Only scans the origin position.

No Parameters.

---

### ColumnLinear

Applies the Pattern to a column of blocks bound by the MinY and MaxY values. The scan is performed linearly from one end of the column to the other and returns all the Pattern validated positions. You can specify the direction of the scan and the maximum valid positions it can return. You can also make the MinY/MaxY scan range local to the scan origin Y instead of the world’s Y:0.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "MaxY",
      description: "integer Y coordinate. Upper exclusive bound of the column.",
    },
    {
      name: "MinY",
      description: "integer Y coordinate. Lower inclusive bound of the column.",
    },
    {
      name: "RelativeToPosition",
      description:
        "Boolean. If true the scan range will be relative to the origin Y of the scan and not the world's Y:0.",
    },
    {
      name: "BaseHeightName",
      description:
        "string. Name of the BaseHeight the scan range will be relative to. If this is provided, then the RelativeToPosition is overridden.",
    },
    {
      name: "TopDownOrder",
      description:
        "Boolean. If true the scan will start at the top of the column's range and go down.",
    },
    {
      name: "ResultCap",
      description:
        "positive integer. The maximum number of valid results this scan will return",
    },
  ]}
/>

### ColumnRandom

Applies the Pattern to a column of blocks bound by the MinY and MaxY values. The scan is performed randomly and returns all the valid positions. You can specify the scan strategy and the maximum valid positions it can return.

There are two strategies you can use with this Scanner:

- DART_THROW: tries random blocks in the column and gathers the ones that validate the Pattern. This strategy is better for situations where there are many valid positions such as wall positions on the side of a cliff.
- PICK_VALID: finds all the valid blocks in the column and randomly picks from the pile. This strategy is better for situations where there are fewer valid positions such as multiple floors stacked on top of each other.

Ultimately, it is up to you to find the right one based on your intent and observation. So try them both!

  ]}

### Area

Useful for increasing the density of rarer props that are difficult to place.

Scans an area around the origin. This Scanner uses the ChildScanner asset slot and gradually scans it farther and farther away from the origin if it can’t find enough valid positions. It applies the ChildScanner on every column surrounding the origin up to the ScanRange distance. The ScanShape determines the shape from above of the total area it can scan. The ResultCap is the total number of valid positions this Scanner will try to find, it will start at the origin and scan more and more of the area until it finds enough results or until it runs out of area.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "ScanRange",
      description:
        "integer 0 or greater. Range in blocks from the scan origin of the area to scan. If the value is 0 then the ChildScanner is only applied on the origin column. A good starting value would be 0 and then increase it by 1 and see the results. In some situations higher values can have an impact on performance.",
    },
    {
      name: "ScanShape",
      description:
        "string, can be CIRCLE or SQUARE. Determines the shape of the scan area.",
    },
    {
      name: "ResultCap",
      description:
        "positive integer. The maximum number of valid results this scan will return",
    },
    {
