title: Curves
description: >-
  Curves map decimal values to other decimal values. They enable the basic f(x)
  = y math expression. These nodes can be used to build the functions you need
  in world-gen.

### Manual

You can plot points that connect with lines to create the curve. The points are connected with straight lines. The function is constant before the first point and after the last point.

The example above shows a function made of 3 points.

### DistanceExponential

The DistanceExponential Curve has the following shape depending on the Exponent value. As this curve’s input approaches the Range value it outputs 0.0. At an input of 0.0, this curve outputs 1.0.

  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Exponent",

### DistanceS

The DistanceS Curve combines two DistanceExponent curves to produce a shape similar to the diagram below. As this curve’s input approaches the Range value it outputs 0.0. At an input of 0.0, this curve outputs 1.0. The asset’s parameters allows you to tweak the shape of the curve.
