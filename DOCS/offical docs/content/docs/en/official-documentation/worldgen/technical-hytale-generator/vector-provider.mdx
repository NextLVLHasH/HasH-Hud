### Constant

Generates the provided vector.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Vector",
      description: "3D decimal vector.",
    },
  ]}
/>

---

### DensityGradient

Generates the gradient of the provided Density field. The resulting gradient vector shows in which direction the Density field is increasing and how fast the field is changing.;

For more information about gradient vectors you can read: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient)

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "SampleDistance",
      description:
        "positive decimal value. How far apart the Density field value samples are taken. The optimal value for performance is 1.0. Greater values could be useful for smoothing out results for specific applications.",
    },
    {
      name: "Density",
      description: "Density slot.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Cache

Caches the input vector for each position.;

This should only be used if the downstream (child) VectorProvider is expensive and the same coordinate is queried more than once.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "SampleDistance",
      description:
        "positive decimal value. How far apart the Density field value samples are taken. The optimal value for performance is 1.0. Greater values could be useful for smoothing out results for specific applications.",
    },
    {
      name: "Density",
      description: "Density slot.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Exported

Allows exporting a VectorProvider as a single instance. Enabling the SingleInstance on this node ensures all importers share the same logic.;

By default a completely different instance is create for every Imported node. When there are multiple Imported nodes that import the same exported key, a new instance of that exported VectorProvider tree will be created for each one of the Imported nodes. SingleInstance ensures all importers share the same underlying instance of the node tree.

This node can be used to optimize caching when an exported VectorProvider is imported multiple times in the same context and contains caches. The caches would be shared between the different imported instances.

_Important: This is still an experimental feature and could cause unexpected behaviors if misused._

Expected Inputs: 1

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "SingleInstance",
      description:
        "boolean. Enable to share the exported for all Imported nodes referencing this key.",
    },
    {
      name: "VectorProvider",
      description: "VectorProvider slot.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Imported

Imports an exported VectorProvider.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Name",
      description: "string. The exported VectorProvider.",
    },
  ]}
/>
