### Solidity

Separates into Solid and Empty terrain blocks and provides a Material Provider slot for each of the two selections.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Solid",
      description: "Material Provider slot.",
    },

### SpaceAndDepth

Allows placing layers of blocks on a terrain’s floor or ceiling surfaces. Layers of Material are piled on each other inside the surface (floor or ceiling) like a cake. There are multiple Layer types, each type providing a unique way to define its thickness. Below is an example of two layers into the floor of our terrain.

![Example of DepthAndSpace Material Provider](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/material-providers/depth-and-space-example.png)

Conditions let you skip this Material Provider if they are not met. An example of this could be a condition that only places grass if there is at least 5 blocks of empty above the surface.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "LayerContext",
      description:
        "string. The context the layers are applied on. For example if the context is DEPTH\_INTO\_FLOOR then the layers will be applied relative to the depth into the floor. So the first layer will be the topmost block of the floor, and each consecutive layer will build deeper under the previous layer. The graphic above illustrates that.\
Possible values: DEPTH\_INTO\_FLOOR and DEPTH\_INTO\_CEILING.",
    },
    {
      name: "MaxExpectedDepth",
      description:
        "Positive Integer. This value helps the system optimize this Material Provider by not performing more depth lookups than necessary. Ideally you should set this value at the maximum expected depth all of the layers combined can have.\
For example, if I have 3 layers in my provider as such: first layer is 1 block thick, second layer is 2 to 4 blocks thick and the third layer is 0 to 5 blocks thick, then my MaxExpectedDepth value should be the maximum of all these layers, in my case 1 + 4 + 5 = 10. Setting a value that is too small might cut off the extreme ends of a layer, while setting a value that is too large might result in poor performance for super complex configs.",
    },
    {
      name: "Condition",
      description:
        "slot for a Condition object, see the Condition’s documentation below. The Material Provider returns no block if the Condition isn’t met for the current block.",
    },
    {
      name: "Layers",
      description:
        "List of Layer objects, see the Layer’s documentation below. The Material Provider will pile the layers from the top of the list down as it gets deeper into the context. The diagram above shows that.",
    },
  ]}
/>

---

### Condition

A Condition object checks if the environment is valid to determine whether the Material Provider should be run for the current block. If the Condition fails for a block then the Material Provider will return no block.

An example of Condition could be to check if there is at least 5 blocks of empty space above the floor. This condition could be useful if you want dirt blocks in tight spaces instead of grass. An example of that is shown below.

![Example of Condition checking space above floor](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/material-providers/condition-space-above-floor.png)

See the [JSON code here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_loYgP38=/?moveToWidget=3458764528990928227&cot=14).

The Condition’s ContextToCheck parameter is the information from the block’s context that you can query in your Condition. In the example above we are checking the SPACE_ABOVE_FLOOR context, which is the number of blocks above the floor. There are currently two possible context values you can use:

- SPACE_ABOVE_FLOOR
- SPACE_BELOW_CEILING

There are multiple Condition types that allow you to compose more complex Conditions from simpler ones. Below are the different types.

**EqualsCondition**

Validates only if a context value is equal to the Condition’s configured value.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "ContextToCheck",
      description:

    },
    {
      name: "Value",
      description:
        "any integer. The only valid value of this Condition, if the context value is different then the Condition fails.",
    },
  ]}
/>

**GreaterThanCondition**

Validates only if a context value is greater than the Condition’s configured threshold.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "ContextToCheck",
      description:

    },
    {
      name: "Threshold",
      description:
        "any integer. For the condition to succeed the context value must be greater than the threshold value.",
    },
  ]}
/>

**SmallerThanCondition**

Validates only if a context value is smaller than the Condition’s configured threshold.

    },
    {
      name: "Threshold",
      description:
        "any integer. For the condition to succeed the context value must be smaller than the threshold value.",
    },
  ]}
/>

**AndCondition**

AND operator logical Condition. Validates only if all of its Condition slots also validate.

#### Parameters:

    {
      name: "Conditions",
      description: "List of Condition slots.",
    },
  ]}

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Condition",
      description:
        "Condition slot. Note that this is a single slot and not a list like the AND and the OR variants.",
    },
  ]}
/>

**AlwaysTrueCondition**

This Condition type always validates.

### Layer

In the DepthAndSpace Material Provider type, Layers are stacked into the depth of the floor or ceiling. Layers have a thickness and Material Provider.

Below are some examples that illustrate how layers work.

Example 1:

- Layer 1: grass of thickness 1.

![Example of Layer 1 grass thickness 1](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/material-providers/layer-example-1.png)

Example 2:

- Layer 1: grass of thickness 1.
- Layer 2: dirt of thickness ranging from 2 to 3.

![Example of Layer 2 grass and dirt](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/material-providers/layer-example-2.png)

Example 3:

- Layer 1: mud of thickness 1 to 5 defined by a 2D simplex noise function.
- Layer 2: dirt of thickness ranging from 2 to 3.

![Example of Layer 3 mud and dirt](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/material-providers/layer-example-3.png)

Example 4: This example shows how this can work not only on floors but also on the ceilings by changing the LayerContext value to DEPTH_INTO_CEILING.

- Layer 1: dirt of thickness in range 2 to 3.

![Example of Layer 4 dirt on ceiling](/assets/official-documentation/worldgen/technical-hytale-generator/material-providers/layer-example-4.png)

End of examples.

Below are documented the different types of Layers.

**ConstantThickness**

Has the same thickness everywhere.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Material",
      description: "slot for Material Provider.",
    },
    {
      name: "Thickness",
      description: "integer greater or equal to 0, the thickness in blocks.",
    },
  ]}
/>

**RangeThickness**

The thickness varies per XZ coordinate and is defined by a range of possible values.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Material",
      description: "slot for Material Provider.",
    },
    {
      name: "RangeMin",
      description:
        "integer greater or equal to 0, the minimum value in blocks the range can have.",
    },
    {
      name: "RangeMax",
      description:
        "integer greater or equal to 0, the maximum inclusive value in blocks the range can have.",
    },
    {
      name: "Seed",
      description: "string.",
    },
  ]}
/>

**WeightedThickness**

The thickness varies per XZ coordinate and is picked from a list of weighted thickness values.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Material",
      description: "slot for Material Provider.",
    },
    {
      name: "PossibleThicknesses",
      description: "a list of weighted thickness values.",
    },
    {
      name: "Seed",
      description: "the seed used when picking the thickness.",
    },
  ]}
/>

**NoiseThickness**

The thickness varies per XZ coordinate and is determined by a noise function tree. Note that the thickness value is determined by the function output, this is why in the example below I normalized the output to be from 0 to 5 because I wanted the thickest point to be around 5 blocks.

#### Parameters:

<ParameterList
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "Material",
      description: "slot for Material Provider.",
    },
    {
      name: "ThicknessFunctionXZ",
      description:
        "a noise function tree. This function is only sampled with XZ inputs with a constant Y of 0. In other words, this function is sampled like a 2D function on the XZ plane.",
    },
  ]}
