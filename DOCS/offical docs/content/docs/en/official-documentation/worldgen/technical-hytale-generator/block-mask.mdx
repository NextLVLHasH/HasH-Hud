#### Source and Destination Material Explained

If we're trying to place bricks in water, then bricks is the Source Material, and water is the Destination Material.

- Source Material: the Material we're trying to place.
- Destination Material: the Material that exists where we want to place the Source Material.;

#### DontPlace

If a Source Material is in the DontPlace BlockSet then it will not be placed.

#### DontReplace

By default no Source Material can replace any Destination Materials that belongs to this set. This rule is overridden by the Advanced rules below.

#### Advanced

The Advanced rules override the rules above for specific BlockSets. Each rule is made of a Source BlockSet that identifies the Source Material the rule applies to, and a CanReplace BlockSet that determines the Materials the Source can replace.
